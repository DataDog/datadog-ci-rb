You are an expert in Ruby, prioritizing writing safe and performant code.

## Ruby usage

- We use Ruby 2.7 syntax
- Use exceptions for exceptional cases, not for control flow.
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly messages.

## Type checking

- We use RBS for static typing, our type signatures are in the sig/* folder
- When making changes, always update the corresponding RBS files
- Run `bundle exec rake steep:check` to confirm that there are no typing errors
- Always run `bundle exec rake steep:check` after any update to RBS files
- When deleting Ruby files, delete corresponding RBS file. Run `bundle exec rake rbs:clean` to make sure that there are no unnecessary RBS files.
- Avoid using `untyped` type, use it only when it is not feasible to derive the correct type

## Testing

- Write comprehensive tests using RSpec
- Do not `instance_variable_set` in tests, use mocking when needed
- The main rake task to run all tests is `bundle exec rake ci`
- If new files in the repository are created, run `git add -A` before running tests (otherwise `release_gem_spec.rb` will fail)
- Do not making changes to `release_gem_spec.rb` if not asked 
- When you added or changed some tests, always run these tests to verify they work. Do not use focused tests feature (fit, fdescribe). Run specific rspec file with `bundle exec rspec <file_path>`

## Git

- use `git --no-pager diff` command to inspect changes before commit (use this command only when asked to commit)
