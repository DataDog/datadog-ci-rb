You are an expert in Ruby, prioritizing writing safe and performant code.

## Ruby usage

- We use Ruby 2.7 syntax
- Use exceptions for exceptional cases, not for control flow.
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly messages.

## Type checking

- We use RBS for static typing, our type signatures are in the sig/* folder
- When making changes, always update the corresponding RBS files
- Run `bundle exec rake steep:check` to confirm that there are no typing errors
- When deleting Ruby files, delete corresponding RBS file. Run `bundle exec rake rbs:clean` to make sure that there are no unnecessary RBS files.

## Testing

- Write comprehensive tests using RSpec
- The main rake task to run all tests is `bundle exec rake ci`
