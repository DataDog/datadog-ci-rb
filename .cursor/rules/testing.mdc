# Testing Guidelines

## Writing Tests

- Tests are written using [RSpec](mdc:https:/rspec.info)
- Test files should mirror the structure of `lib`
- All changes should be covered by corresponding tests
- Place tests in the `spec/datadog/ci` folder
- If new files in the repository are created, run `git add -A` before running tests (otherwise `release_gem_spec.rb` will fail)
- Do not use `instance_variable_set` and `instance_variable_get` in tests, use mocking when needed
- Do not make changes to `release_gem_spec.rb` if not asked
- Do not use focused tests feature (fit, fdescribe)

## Running Tests

- Run the full test suite: `bundle exec rake ci`
- Run core library tests: `bundle exec rake test:main`
- Run integration tests: `bundle exec rake test:<integration_name>`
- Run a specific test/file from core library tests: `bundle exec rspec <relative path to the file>`

## CI Configuration

- New contrib folders should have a corresponding Rake task in `Rakefile`
- New test tasks should be added to the test matrix in `TEST_METADATA`
- CI runs tests against multiple Ruby versions (2.7, 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, jruby-9)

## Appraisal Groups

- Dependency configurations are managed with [Appraisal](mdc:https:/github.com/thoughtbot/appraisal)
- Group definitions are in `Appraisals`
- Generate gemfiles with `bundle exec appraisal generate`
- Install dependencies with `bundle exec appraisal install`
